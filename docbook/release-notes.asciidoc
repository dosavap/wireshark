=== New and Updated Features

The following features are new (or have been significantly updated)
since version 2.2.0:

* Experimental 32-bit and 64-bit Windows Installer (.msi) packages are available.
  It is recommended that you use these independently of the NSIS (.exe) installers.
  That is, you should make sure the NSIS package is completely uninstalled before
  installing the Windows Installer package and vice-versa.
* Source packages are now compressed using xz instead of bzip2.
* The legacy (GTK+) UI is disabled by default in the Windows installer.
* The legacy (GTK+) UI is disabled by default in Autotools and CMake.
* SS7 Point Codes can now be resolved into names with a hosts-like file.
* Wireshark can now go fullscreen to have more room for packets.
* TShark can now export objects like the other GUI interfaces.
* Support for G.722 and G.726 codecs in the RTP Player (via the SpanDSP library).
* You can now choose the output device when playing RTP streams.
* Added support for dissectors to include a unit name natively in their hf field.
  A field can now automatically append "seconds" or "ms" to its value without
  additional printf-style APIs.

== Getting Wireshark

=== Vendor-supplied Packages

Most Linux and Unix vendors supply their own Wireshark packages. You can
usually install or upgrade Wireshark using the package management system
specific to that platform. A list of third-party packages can be found
on the https://www.wireshark.org/download.html#thirdparty[download page]
on the Wireshark web site.

== File Locations

Wireshark and TShark look in several different locations for preference
files, plugins, SNMP MIBS, and RADIUS dictionaries. These locations vary
from platform to platform. You can use Aboutâ†’Folders to find the default
locations on your system.
